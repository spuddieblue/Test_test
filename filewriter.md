# FileWriter vs PrintWriter: Concise Guide

## FileWriter

### Use When:
- You need **basic writing capabilities**.
- Writing **raw characters or simple strings** without advanced formatting.
- You want **minimal overhead** and donâ€™t need buffering or advanced features.

### Key Features:
- Writes **raw characters or strings**.
- Does **not auto-flush** (relies on the OS to handle writes).
- Requires manual addition of **line breaks** (`\n`).
- Interprets `write(int)` as a Unicode code point (not the number itself).

### Example:
```java
FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("example.txt");
writer.write("Hello, FileWriter!\n");
writer.write("Another line.\n");
writer.write(String.valueOf(56));  // Converts number to a string manually
writer.close();
```
Output:
text
Copy code
Hello, FileWriter!
Another line.
56
PrintWriter
Use When:
You need advanced convenience and formatting capabilities.
Writing different data types (e.g., int, float, boolean) without manual conversion.
Automatically handling line breaks (println()).
You want additional tools like formatted output (printf) or error checking (checkError()).
Key Features:
Provides methods like println(), print(), and printf() for formatting and structured output.
Automatically converts data types to strings.
Supports buffering to minimize file operations.
Offers an optional checkError() method to verify errors.
Example:
java
Copy code
PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("example.txt"));
writer.println("Hello, PrintWriter!");
writer.printf("Formatted number: %.2f%n", 56.78);
writer.println(56);  // Automatically converts the number to a string
writer.close();
Output:
text
Copy code
Hello, PrintWriter!
Formatted number: 56.78
56
Comparison Table
Feature	FileWriter	PrintWriter
Ease of Use	Basic	Advanced
Formatting	Manual (e.g., concatenation)	Built-in with printf()
Line Breaks	Must add \n manually	Automatic with println()
Data Type Support	Strings and single characters	Handles all types (int, float, etc.)
Buffered Output	Relies on OS buffering	Adds Java-level buffering
Error Checking	No direct support	Built-in with checkError()
Best Use Case	Lightweight, raw writing	Structured, formatted writing
When to Choose One
Choose FileWriter:
For basic, minimalistic file writing with no need for formatting or data type conversion.
When you want lower overhead for performance-critical tasks.
Choose PrintWriter:
For convenience, flexibility, and formatted output.
When you need to handle multiple data types or want easy-to-read, maintainable code.

### Key Points:
- **Outputs are properly enclosed in code blocks** (` ```text `).
- **All headings, code examples, and explanations are properly formatted** in Markdown.
- The comparison table is fully Markdown-compliant.
